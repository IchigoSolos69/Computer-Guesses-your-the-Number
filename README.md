# Number Guessing Game

An interactive command-line game where the computer uses bitwise techniques to deduce the number you re thinking of (1 to 100).

## Features

- **Bitwise Deduction**: Utilizes binary sets and bitwise math to guess your number in at most 7 questions.
- **Clear Interface**: Simple, text-based prompts guide you through each round.
- **Animated Intro**: Dynamic ASCII art and timed prints for an engaging start.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adimaitre/number-guess-cli.git
cd number-guess-cli
```

## Usage

1. Run the game:
```bash
python computer_guesses_the_number.py
```
2. Think of a number between 1 and 100.
3. Answer the prompts with `y` or `yes` when your number appears on the displayed lists.
4. The computer will reveal your number at the end.
